                <h1>ECA Work, Section 10</h1>
                <p>For the current work we are going to undertake, let's get the context of the excercise fresh in our mind.</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://utorontopress.com/9780802082220/for-a-new-political-economy/">
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the present section may be put as follows. Consider two successive and equal intervals of time, long enough to be representative, yet not so long that much averaging is required. Suppose that in the first of the two intervals, objects of a class \(i\) were sold in the quantity \(q_{i}\) and at an average price \(p_{i}\), and in the second interval objects in the same class were sold in the quantity \(q_{i}+dq_{i}\) and at the average price \(p_{i}+dp_{i}\) Suppose, further, that there are \(n\) such classes, that the aggregate payment for them in the first interval was \(DZ\) and in the second interval was \(DZ+D^{^{2}}Z\) so that
                    \[DZ=\sum p_iq_i\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (16) \]
                    \[DZ+D^{^{2}}Z=\sum (p_i q_i + p_i dq_i + q_i dp_i + dp_i dq_i )\ \ \ \ \ \ (17) \]
                    where all summations are taken with respect to all isntances of \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). The question is, How much does the increment in the rate of payment \(D^{^{2}}Z\) result from price increments \(dp_i\), and how much does it result from quantity increments \(dq_i\)? In other words, can one define two numbers, say \(P\) and \(Q\), such that \(P\) varies with a set of numbers \(p_1,\ p_2,\  p_3,\ ...\) and \(Q\) varies with another set of numbers \(q_1,\ q_2,\  q_3,\ ...\)</br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A universally valid answer to this question may be had when \(P\) and \(Q\) are not mere numbers but vections in an \(n\)-dimensional manifold. Let \(P\) and \(Q\) be the vectors from the origion to the points \((p_1,p_2,p_3,...)\) and \((q_1,q_2,q_3,...)\), respectively. Then any variation in the price pattern, that is, in any ratio of the type \(p_i / p_j\), will appear as a variation in the angle between the projection of \(P\) on the plane \(ij\) and the axis \(j\). Similarly, any variation in the quantity pattern will appear as a parallel variation in an angle made by a projection of \(Q\). But besides such variation in price pattern or in quantity pattern there may be general increases or descrases in prices or in quantities. The latter appear as positive or negative increments in the absolute magnitudes of the vectors, for
